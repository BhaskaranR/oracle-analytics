# Grouping Comments by Rules in Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch does **not support SQL-style joins**, so you **cannot directly group comments by matching rules** in a single native query. But you can simulate this behavior in two reliable ways:

---

## âœ… Option 1: Use `_msearch` (Multi-Search)

Send multiple queries (one per rule) in a single request:

```bash
POST /comments/_msearch
{ }
{ "query": { "span_near": {
      "clauses": [
        { "span_term": { "comment_text": "career" } },
        { "span_term": { "comment_text": "growth" } }
      ],
      "slop": 5,
      "in_order": false
    }
  }
}
{ }
{ "query": { "span_near": {
      "clauses": [
        { "span_term": { "comment_text": "internal" } },
        { "span_term": { "comment_text": "transfer" } }
      ],
      "slop": 4,
      "in_order": false
    }
  }
}
```

Each result block includes `hits.total.value` â€” the count of matches. You associate each block with the corresponding rule ID/topic.

## âœ… Option 2: Materialize Rule Matches

1. Periodically run each ruleâ€™s query against `/comments`
2. For each match, insert into a new index like `/comment_rule_matches`:

```json
{
  "comment_id": 101,
  "rule_id": 4,
  "topic": "Internal Mobility"
}
```

3. Then group using an aggregation query:

```json
GET /comment_rule_matches/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "by_rule": {
      "terms": { "field": "rule_id" },
      "aggs": {
        "by_topic": {
          "terms": { "field": "topic" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This gives you full **group-by-rule analytics**, similar to Oracle or SQL engines.

## ðŸš« Why One-Query Doesn't Work

- Rules and comments are in separate indices.
- Elasticsearch doesnâ€™t join or "push" rules into the comment index.
- You need an external loop, script, or materialized index.

## âœ… Summary

| Strategy                 | Aggregation Support | Complexity | Live Use |
|--------------------------|---------------------|------------|----------|
| `_msearch` loop          | External aggregation| Low        | âœ… Fast   |
| Materialized match index| Full aggregation    | Medium     | âœ… Robust |

Let me know if you want Python scripts for either strategy.
